summary: Simulations of Clayton High School's robot, for developing robot code without the robot.

I made a simulation of my robotics team’s robot. I run a virtual robot and the robot’s code on my computer simultaneously; they connect with each other and I can interact with the virtual robot in exactly the same way as the real one. In addition, the code is the same for both the virtual and real robot, so it’s easy to test my code without the real robot.

I actually have two separate simulations, one from 2019 and another from 2020. I’m showing both because 2019 was the prototype and looks more interesting, but I actually used 2020 for developing autonomous path following on our robot, which was a huge advance for our team.

I built the robot simulations with C# using Unity and Visual Studio, while the code actually used for the robot was made with Java using WPILib and Visual Studio Code.

### 2019 Simulation Prototype

Here's a video demonstrating the 2019 simulation and comparing it to the 2019 robot.

### 2020 Simulation

Here's a video demonstrating the 2020 simulation and comparing it to the 2020 robot. The simulation uses the same code as the real robot!!!
