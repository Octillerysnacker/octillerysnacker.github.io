summary: Simulations of Clayton High School's robot, for developing robot code at home.

I made a simulation of my robotics team’s robot. I run a virtual robot and the robot’s code on my computer simultaneously; they connect with each other and I can interact with the virtual robot in exactly the same way as the real one. In addition, the code is the same for both the virtual and real robot, so it’s easy to test my code without the real robot.

I actually have two separate simulations, one from 2019 and another from 2020. I’m showing both because 2019 was the prototype and looks more interesting, but I actually used 2020 for developing autonomous path following on our robot, which was a huge advance for our team.

I built the robot simulations with C# using Unity and Visual Studio, while the code actually used for the robot was made with Java using WPILib and Visual Studio Code.

## Videos

### 2019 Simulation Prototype

I start up the video showing simulated robot code and the program we use to drive the robot in real life. Unfortunately, it’s not the same code as our 2019 robot, but the capability exists. I show I can move and steer the robot with the controller.

Same scenario as above, but I show that the simulated robot can pick up balls and place them in structures.

The release video for our real 2019 robot as a comparison to the simulation (starting at 34 seconds to show ball placing.) Obviously, the real robot has plenty more capabilities but I had no reason to implement everything.

### 2020 Simulation

I show a virtual robot autonomously following a set path. It’s the same code used on the real 2020 robot!!!
