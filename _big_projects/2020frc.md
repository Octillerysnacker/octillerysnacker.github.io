As a programming team lead for the robotics team, I solved the hardest software problems. Our team built an extremely capable robot, and I definitely could not have programmed all the features without the great craftsmanship of the physical engineers. 

I have 3 main features that I’m proud of:

1. Autonomous - For the first time, our team had a robot which could follow paths on its own, allowing much more complex automated functions. We could chain actions, such as: follow this path, pick up these balls, follow this other path, shoot the balls, etc. I was able to use the 2020 Simulation to develop this before the robot even existed.

2. Vision Processing - Our robot has a turret which would be a pain to aim manually. So, using a vision camera, we were able to automate the alignment of the turret, so drivers could shoot freely without worrying about aiming. Again, our team had never had complex vision capabilities.

3. Swerve Drive - The drive base of our robot moves like an office chair, and the behaviour is pretty complicated. While we had this for our 2019 robot, I essentially rewrote the whole thing in a much cleaner and extendable fashion, which also allowed me to use the 2020 simulation in the first place.

The whole thing is made with Java using WPILib and VS Code.

Here’s a video with all the key features I described: autonomous path following, automatic turret alignment using vision, and swerve drive!
