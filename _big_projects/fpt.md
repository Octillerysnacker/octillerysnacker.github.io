FRC Programmer Trainer was my attempt to make a hands-on Codecademy-esque program which taught new members how to code, directly in VS Code. You choose an exercise to load, and the program opens up a folder with instructions. Then, once you have your files, you “submit” your code, and it is automatically checked by the program!

The program is monstrous. It’s split up into 5 separate projects with an additional project for each level. It’s a VSCode extension made with TypeScript, Java, C#, and a few random batch files. I used both VS Code and Visual Studio. This extension was also my introduction to unit testing, which I’m highly thankful for.

## Videos

I made a video showcasing the program to my computer science teacher:
