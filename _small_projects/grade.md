summary: A command line application to manage classes and grades.

I made this project for my AP CompSci Principles course as the create task. It’s essentially a command line class manager, where you can add classes (but can’t remove them.) In addition, the classes are stored in a database so that your classes are saved when you open and close the program. While a command line application is not the most user friendly, I enjoyed learning how to connect my programs to databases.

I made the program in C# using VS Code and .NET Entity Framework Core.
