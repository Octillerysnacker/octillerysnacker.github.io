summary: A command line application to manage classes and grades.

I made this project for my AP CompSci Principles course as the create task. It’s essentially a command line class manager, where you can add classes (but can’t remove them.) In addition, the classes are stored in a database so that your classes are saved when you open and close the program.

I made the program in C# using VS Code and .NET Entity Framework Core.

## Videos

I made a video which shows the program in action. I open up the program and type the “help” command to show all commands. I display my courses, add a course, and check my courses again. Then I enter a bad command to show the program handling errors. Finally, I close and reopen the program to show that the class has been saved.
