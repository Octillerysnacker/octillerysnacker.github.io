summary: A program to explore machine learning with genetic algorithms.

In my AP Computer Science Principles class, I was introduced to the genetic algorithm. Essentially, a genetic algorithm mimics the process of evolution. It starts out with a bunch of solutions, tests how well they solve a problem, and then combines the best solutions to create better ones. The particular genetic algorithm shown in class tries to turn a random string of ones and zeros into a string of just ones. While this problem is quite simple, these ones and zeros can represent anything, such as a blueprint for a car or the connections of a neural network.

I made this in C# using VS Code.
