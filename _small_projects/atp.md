In my AP Biology class, we learned about this weird enzyme called ATP Synthase. It’s basically a water turbine that uses electrons and it looks so funny I decided to make my own.

In my program, the electrons are flying around freely and are attracted to the ATP Synthase objects. The ATP Synthase picks up the electrons, spins a bit, and releases it. It’s fun to watch.

I made this in C# using Unity and Visual Studio.

## Videos

I show a single, immobile ATP Synthase which accepts electrons, spins, and sends them off.

I show two freely flying ATP Synthase with a bunch of floating electrons.
