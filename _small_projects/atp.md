name: Flying ATP Synthase

summary: A silly little physics simulation about spinning, flying enzymes.
---
In my AP Biology class, we learned about this weird enzyme called ATP Synthase. It’s basically a water turbine that uses electrons instead of water, and it looks so funny I decided to make my own.

In my program, the electrons are flying around freely and are attracted to the ATP Synthase objects. The ATP Synthase picks up the electrons, spins a bit, and releases it. It’s fun to watch.

I made this in C# using Unity and Visual Studio.

## Videos

This video is just a two minute clip of the simulation running. You can see ATP Synthase objects flying around and yellow electrons floating towards them. Once absorbed by the ATP Synthase, the electrons spin for one revolution and are then shot back out into the environment. The turbine on the ATP Synthase only spins when electrons are attached.
