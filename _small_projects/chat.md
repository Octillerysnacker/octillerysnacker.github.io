I made a chatroom to try out real time communication between programs and computers. Thatâ€™s about it.

The chatroom is made in C# and uses ASP.NET SignalR and is hosted on Azure.

## Videos

I made a video which shows me navigating to the website, changing my username, and sending  a message. One of my friends is also on the website and sends me a message back.
